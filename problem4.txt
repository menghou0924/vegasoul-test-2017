DESCRIPTION
===========
Implement an algorithm to select m lines from a large file such that each
line in the file shall have an equal probability of being selected.

The large file may only be accessed using 3 APIs, namely:
- hasNext() which returns a boolean indicating if there is a next line;
- getLine() which returns the next line from the file;
- reset() which resets the file pointer to the start of the file.

Your solution should aim for correctness and efficiency.
You may indicate any reasonable assumptions that you made.
